# x402-farm

**64 pay-per-call APIs that AI agents pay for autonomously** — via the [x402 protocol](https://github.com/coinbase/x402) (USDC on Base). No account, no API key, no subscription: the agent gets an HTTP `402`, signs a micro-payment, retries, gets the data. Settlement is on-chain, per call, from $0.002.

**Live at [api.x-402.online](https://api.x-402.online)** · MCP: `online.x-402/mcp` on the [official registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=x-402) and [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/servers/laurenthalbrun/x402-farm)

## Try it in 60 seconds

**Free taste, no wallet** — every client gets **1 free call per day** on any data route ≤ $0.01. Just call:

```bash
curl "https://api.x-402.online/v1/weather?city=Tokyo"
curl "https://api.x-402.online/v1/crypto/price?ids=bitcoin,ethereum&vs=usd"
```

**Paid, with any x402 client** (funded USDC wallet on Base):

```js
import { wrapFetchWithPaymentFromConfig } from "@x402/fetch";
import { ExactEvmScheme } from "@x402/evm";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

const f = wrapFetchWithPaymentFromConfig(fetch, {
  schemes: [{ network: "eip155:8453", client: new ExactEvmScheme(privateKeyToAccount(PRIVATE_KEY)) }],
});
const r = await f("https://api.x-402.online/v1/search?q=x402"); // $0.003, settled on-chain
console.log(await r.json());
```

## Agent-friendly by design

- **Every route accepts GET and POST** (query params or JSON body — your call)
- **Progressive pricing**: big composites have a `/partial` LITE version from $0.02; every `402` response advertises the cheaper alternative and free trial in an `alternatives` field
- **MCP server** at [`/mcp`](https://api.x-402.online/mcp) (JSON-RPC, Streamable HTTP): 64 tools, x402 payment relayed end-to-end — proven on-chain
- **Multi-surface discovery**: Bazaar extensions, `llms.txt`, OpenAPI, agent-skills, `Link` headers

## Architecture

Vercel (paywall x402 + fast APIs) → Cloudflare named tunnel → **Mac mini worker** (residential IP, real Chromium, auth-gated sources like INPI) with automatic datacenter fallback. Analytics + a daily on-chain **market radar** (unique payers per service across the whole x402 ecosystem) drive which APIs live or die.

## Stack

Express · `@x402/express` (multi-network resource server) · Coinbase CDP facilitator · Supabase (analytics) · Playwright · deployed on Vercel + a Mac mini.
